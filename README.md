#ACTON FC PROJECT
##This is my project for milestone project 1
This is a website about a fictional football club.
The main aim of the site is to attract new club members.
The homepage contains a team photo with the clubs stadium name and address in a red box, so it stands out to users of the site.
Another aim of the website is to make fans aware of upcoming fixtures and the time,place and opponent of fixures.
Underneath there is a reasons section to why you should become a member and the benefits of a membership, its called a "White Army Membership" as the clubs home shirt is a White shirt.
I have included a navbar with links to the Homepage, a fixures and previous matches page, a merchandise page and a membership signup page.
Within the fixtures page, the 5 upcoming fixtures will be shown first, with the 5 results from previous matches underneath, the previous matches will also include details such as dates, attendance, score and goalscorers.
The next link in the navbar is the merchandise page, this will just show what fans can purchase in our club shop which is attatched to the stadium, this will include our replica training top, replica 2nd top, replica 3rd alternative top. A choice of scarves ranging from red, blue and green and also an Acton FC mug.
The final link in the navbar is a membership signup form. Once a fan has submitted their details in the formbox they will be sent an email which will direct them to a payment website which will vary in price depending on the type of membership they choose (Adult, Junior or over  60's). Bottom left of the screen will be the proud historic badge of our great football club.
The footer of all pages will include links to all our social media accounts, Facebook, X (formally known as Twitter), YouTube and Instagram.
